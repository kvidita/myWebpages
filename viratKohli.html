          November 1988) is an Indian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket"
            style="text-decoration: none;">international cricketer</a>
          and the former captain of the Indian national cricket team who plays as a right-handed <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)">batsman</a> for <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore">Royal Challengers Bangalore</a> in the
          IPL
          and for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi" style="text-decoration: none;">Delhi</a> in Indian
          domestic cricket. Widely regarded as one of the greatest
          batsmen
          of
          all
          time,[4] Kohli holds the records for scoring most runs in <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20_International">T20 internationals</a> and in the IPL. In
          2020,
          the
          International
          Cricket Council named him the male cricketer of the decade. Kohli has also contributed to India's successes,
          including
          winning the 2011 World Cup and the 2013 Champions trophy.Born and raised in New Delhi, Kohli trained at the
          West
          Delhi Cricket Academy and started his youth career with the
          Delhi Under-15 team. He made his international debut in 2008 and quickly became a key player in the ODI team
          and
          later
          made his Test debut in 2011. In 2013, Kohli reached the number one spot in the ICC rankings for ODI batsmen
          for
          the
          first time. During 2014 T20 World Cup, he set a record for the most runs scored in the tournament. In 2018,
          he
          achieved
          yet another milestone, becoming the world's top-ranked Test batsman, making him the only Indian cricketer to
          hold the
          number one spot in all three formats of the game. His form continued in 2019, when he became the first
          player
          to
          score
          20,000 international runs in a single decade. In 2021, Kohli made the decision to step down as the captain
          of
          the Indian
          national team for T20Is, following the T20 World Cup and in early 2022 he stepped down as the captain of the
          Test team
          as well.

          occasions, in
          2017 and 2018 respectively. Subsequently, Kohli also won ICC Test Player of the Year and ICC ODI Player of
          the
          Year
          awards in 2018, becoming the first player to win both awards in the same year. Additionally, he was named
          the
          Wisden
          Leading Cricketer in the World for three consecutive years, from 2016 to 2018. At the national level, Kohli

          with the Arjuna Award in 2013, the Padma Shri under the sports category in 2017 and the Khel Ratna award,
          India's
          highest sporting honour, in 2018.

        <h2 id="Early life">Early life</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>Virat Kohli was born on 5 November 1988 in Delhi into a Punjabi Hindu family. His father, Prem Kohli,
          worked
          as a
          criminal lawyer and his mother, Saroj Kohli, served as a housewife. He has an older brother, Vikas, and an
          older sister,
          Bhawna.[5] Kohli's formative years were spent in the Uttam Nagar and commenced his early education at Vishal
          Bharti
          Public School.[6] According to his family, Kohli exhibited an early affinity for cricket as a mere
          three-year-old. He
          would pick up a cricket bat, display natural skill, and request his father to bowl to him.[7]
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1998, the West Delhi Cricket Academy (WCDA) was created and on 30 May of that year, Prem Kohli, espoused
          his younger
          son's fervour for cricket, assisted nine-year-old Kohli's aspirations and arranged for him to meet Rajkumar
          Sharma, who
          initially perceived him to be just another enthusiastic and determined young boy. However, two weeks later,
          Sharma was
          impressed by Kohli's accuracy and power in throwing.[8] Upon the suggestion of their neighbours, Kohli's
          father
          considered enrolling his son in a professional cricket academy, as they believed that his cricketing
          abilities
          merited
          more than just playing in the gully cricket.[9] Despite his abilities, he faced the setback of being unable
          to
          secure a
          place in the under-14 Delhi team, not due to a lack of merit but due to extraneous factors. Prem Kohli
          received offers
          to relocate his son to influential clubs, which would have ensured his selection, but he declined the
          proposals, as he
          was determined that Kohli should earn his recognition based on his own merit and overcome the system of
          nepotism and
          deceit prevalent in the Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA). Kohli persisted and eventually found
          his way into
          the under-15 Delhi team.[10] He received training at the academy while simultaneously participating in
          matches
          at the
          Sumeet Dogra Academy located at Vasundhara Enclave.[11] As per Sharma's recollection of Kohli's initial days
          at his
          academy, he exuded remarkable talent, making it arduous for the coach to curb his enthusiasm. Kohli remained
          prepared to
          bat at any position, and often, Sharma had to physically coerce him to leave the training sessions, as he
          was
          reluctant
          to depart.[12] In pursuit of furthering his cricketing career, he transitioned to Saviour Convent School
          during his
          ninth-grade education.[9] Kohli's ardent passion for cricket compelled him to travel long distances with his
          father to
          ensure that he never missed a match. With time, he diligently honed his skills and diversified his range of
          shots,
          commanding respect from the local bowlers.[13]
        </p>
        <p>
          On the 18th of December 2006, Kohli experienced the loss of his father due to a cerebral attack.[9][14]
          During
          his
          childhood, his father played a crucial role in supporting his cricket training. Kohli has credited his
          father
          as the one
          who drove him to practice every day. He has expressed his feelings of missing his father's presence at
          times.[6][15]
          Following the demise of Kohli's father, his mother observed a significant change in his personality. Kohli
          appeared to
          become more mature overnight, and he began taking every cricket match seriously. He harboured an aversion to
          exclusion
          from games and appeared to channel his entire existence into the pursuit of cricket following his father's
          untimely
          demise.[9] Kohli's family resided in Meera Bagh, Paschim Vihar until the year 2015, after which they
          relocated
          to
          Gurgaon.[16]</p>

        <hr />
        <h3>Delhi</h3>
        <p>
          Kohli's junior cricket career kicked off in October 2002 at the Luhnu cricket ground in a Polly Umrigar
          match
          against
          the host state of Himachal Pradesh. In his debut match, Kohli managed to score a total of fifteen runs. His
          first
          half-century in national cricket came at Ferozeshah Kotla, where he scored 70 runs against Harayana.[17] By
          the end of
          the season, Kohli had amassed a total of 172 runs, emerging as the highest run-scorer for his side with an
          average of
          34.40.[18] During the 2003-04 season, Kohli was appointed as the captain of the under-15 team. In his first
          match of the
          season, he scored 54 runs in Delhi's victory over Himachal Pradesh. In the next fixture against Jammu and
          Kashmir, Kohli
          scored his maiden century with a score of 119 in a BCCI-conducted game. By the end of the season, he had
          amassed a total
          of 390 runs at an average of 78, which included two centuries.[19][20][a] Towards the end of 2004, Kohli
          earned
          selection for the 2004-05 Vijay Merchant Trophy with the Delhi under-17 team. In the four matches that he
          played, Kohli
          accumulated a total of 470 runs, with his highest score being 251* runs. The team's coach, Ajit Chaudhary,
          lauded his
          performance and was particularly impressed with his temperament on the field.[22][23] In the 2005-06 season,
          Kohli
          commenced his innings with a score of 227 against Punjab. Following their victory over Uttar Pradesh in the
          quarter-finals, Delhi was scheduled to play against Baroda in the semi-finals. The team had high
          expectations
          from
          Kohli, who had promised his coach to finish the job. True to his word, Kohli went on to score 228 runs,
          leading Delhi to
          victory. The team later secured the tournament with a five-wicket win over Mumbai, where he contributed with
          a
          half-century in the first innings.[24] He ended as the highest run-scorer with a total of 757 runs from 7
          matches,
          averaging 84.11.[25]
        </p>
        <h3>India Under-19</h3>
        <p>In July 2006, Kohli was selected in the India Under-19 squad on its tour of England. He averaged 105 in the
          three-match
          ODI series against England Under-19s,[34] while also averaging 49 in the three-match Test series.[35]
          Following India
          Under-19's success in both the ODI and Test series, the team's coach Lalchand Rajput noted Kohli's adeptness
          in facing
          both pace and spin bowling and expressed his admiration for profound technical prowess.[36] In September,
          the
          India
          Under-19 team toured Pakistan. In the first Test match, Kohli scored 63 and 28 as India won by 271 runs
          against Pakistan
          Under-19s. In the second match, he contributed 83 runs to India's victory by 240 runs and an innings. He
          concluded the
          tour with 80 runs in the final ODI game at Lahore.[37] In early 2007, Kohli was a part of the India Under-19
          team that
          toured New Zealand, where he scored 113 in the first Test match. The series ended in a draw with a 1-1 score
          line. In
          the following month, the team travelled to Malaysia for a tri-series against England Under-19s and Sri Lanka
          Under-19s,
          where Kohli did not get many opportunities to bat. In July-August, India Under-19 embarked on a tour for a
          tri-series
          against Sri Lanka Under-19s and Bangladesh Under-19s, where he did not score a half-century in any of the
          matches.
          However, he made a comeback with scores of 144 and an unbeaten 94 in the following Test series.[38]</p>

        <h2 id="international career">International career</h2>
        <hr />
        <h3>2008–2009: Debut and maiden stint</h3>
        <p>
          In August 2008, Kohli was selected for inclusion in the ODl squad for the tour of Sri Lanka and the
          Champions
          Trophy in
          Pakistan. Prior to the Sri Lankan tour, Kohli had limited experience, with only eight List A matches under
          his
          belt.[45]
          So, his selection was considered a "surprise call-up".[46] During the Sri Lankan tour, as both first-choice
          openers
          Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag, were unable to play due to injury, Kohli was required to fill the role
          of
          makeshift opener throughout the series.[47] On 18 August 2008, Kohli made his international debut at the age
          of 19 in
          the first ODI of the tour, where he was dismissed for 12 runs, caught dead in front by an incutter from
          Nuwan
          Kulasekara.[48] However, in the fourth match of the series, Kohli achieved his inaugural half century in the
          ODl format,
          with a total of fifty-four runs scored.[49]
        </p>
        <p>

          Following the postponement of the Champions Trophy to 2009, Kohli was picked as a replacement for the
          injured
          Shikhar
          Dhawan in the India A squad for the unofficial Tests against Australia A in September 2008.[50] Despite
          limited
          opportunities, he managed to make an impact in the single innings that he participated in, scoring 49
          runs.[51] In
          October 2008, Kohli participated in a four-day tour match against Australia as part of the Indian Board
          President's XI
          team. The match featured a formidable Australian bowling line-up that consisted of Brett Lee, Stuart Clark,
          Mitchell
          Johnson, Peter Siddle and Jason Krejza. Despite this, Kohli displayed his batting prowess by scoring 105
          runs
          in the
          first innings and an unbeaten 16 runs in the second innings, demonstrating his ability to perform against
          high-level
          international competition.[52]
